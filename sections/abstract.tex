Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) use their internal state to operate on data
time-series. One of the domains in which RNNs are applied is speech recognition.
In this paper, the focus will be on the task of end-to-end isolated word
recognition.  We apply RNN and feedforward Neural Networks as the baseline for
the recognition and compare it to more sophisticated RNN models.
