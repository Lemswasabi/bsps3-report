Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in comparison with conventional feedforward
Neural Networks, use their internal state to operate on data series. One of the
domains in which RNNs are applied is speech recognition. In this paper, the
focus will be on the classification of spoken words to their according labels.
We apply RNN, Long short-term memory (LSTM) and feedforward Neural Networks for
the classification and compare their accuracies.
