\section{Pre-requisites ($[5\%..10\%]$ of total words)} 
\textcolor{gray}{Describe in these sections the main scientific and technical
  knowledge that is required to be known by you before starting the project.  Do
  not describe in details this knowledge but only abstractly. All the content of
  this section shall not used, even partly, in the deliverable sections.}\\

In order to start on the project, certain skills in programming
and mathematics are required. In particular, the preliminary requirement of
the project is as follow:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Understanding of vector and matrix algebra.
        \item Introductory course in Python.
        \item Software development.
        \item Knowledge of probability and statistics, but it is not
                mandatory.
\end{itemize}
