\subsection{Targeted Deliverables}

\subsubsection{Scientific deliverables}

One of the main deliverables is to present how to extract the features from the
dataset with Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFFCs). Additionally, we
present the notions of Deep learning. This paper gives a brief introduction to
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and their application for classification.
Further, we extend this scientific presentation by diving deeper into two
different ANNs; Feedforward Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
Special cases of RNN such as gated RNNs are furthermore investigated. This
includes long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU). Finally,
we compare their performances obtained after being trained on the given audio
dataset.

\subsubsection{Technical deliverables} 

The other main deliverable for this paper is the implementation of an end-to-end
speech recognition model based on the four Neural Networks, i.e. feed-forward
neural networks, standard RNNs, LSTM and GRU. Additionally, we collect a small
dataset of Luxembourgish spoken words $w \in \{'0',\dots,'9'\}$ to train our
model to recognize these words. To the best of our knowledge, there are no
publically available datasets for speech recognition of the Luxembourgish
language.
