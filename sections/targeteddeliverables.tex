% -model implementation
% -luxembourgish data collection

One of the main deliverables is to present how we extract the features from the
dataset with Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFFC). Additionally, we
present the notions of Deep learning. This paper should give a small
introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and their application for
classification. Further, we extend this scientifical presentation by diving
deeper into three different ANNs; Feedforward Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM). Finally, we compare their
accuracies obtained after being trained on the given audio dataset.

\subsubsection{Technical deliverables} 

The other main deliverable for this paper is to implement our classification
model based on the three Neural Networks mentioned in the section above.
Additionally, we collect a small dataset of Luxembourgish spoken words $w \in
\{'0',\dots,'9','moien'\}$ to train our model to classify these words.
