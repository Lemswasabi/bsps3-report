\subsection{Targeted Deliverables}

\subsubsection{Scientific deliverables}

% Scientific
% -fnn
% -rnn
% -lstm
% -data preprocessing with mfcc
% -accuracy comparison

% Technical
% -model implementation
% -luxembourgish data collection

One of the main deliverables is to present the notions of deep learning. This
paper should give a small introduction to Neural networks and their application
for classification. Further, we extend this scientifical presentation by diving
deeper into three different Neural Networks; Feedforward Neural Networks,
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM). Additionally,
we explain how we extract the features from the dataset. Finally, we compare
their accuracies obtained after being trained on the given audio dataset.\\

deliverables that were targeted to be produced.}

\subsubsection{Technical deliverables} 

The other main deliverable for this paper is to implement our classification
model based on the three Neural Networks mentioned in the section above.
Additionally, we collect a small dataset of Luxembourgish spoken words $w \in
\{'0',...,'9','moien'\}$ to train our model to classify these words.\\
