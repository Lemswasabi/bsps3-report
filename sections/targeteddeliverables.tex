One of the main deliverables is to present how we extract the features from the
dataset with Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFFC). Additionally, we
present the notions of Deep learning. This paper gives a brief introduction to
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and their application for classification.
Further, we extend this scientific presentation by diving deeper into three
different ANNs; Feedforward Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and
Long short-term memory (LSTM) as a special case of RNN. Finally, we compare
their performances obtained after being trained on the given audio dataset.

\subsubsection{Technical deliverables} 

The other main deliverable for this paper is the implementation of an end-to-end
speech recognition model based on the three Neural Networks mentioned in the
section above.  Additionally, we collect a small dataset of Luxembourgish spoken
words $w \in \{'0',\dots,'9','moien'\}$ to train our model to recognize these
words. Since, to the best of our knowledge, there are no publically available
datasets for speech recognition of the Luxembourgish language.
