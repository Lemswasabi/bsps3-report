\subsection{Constraints}

For this BSP, we set the different constraints for the Neural Networks, for the
Luxembourgish vocal dataset and the classification model's implementation.\\

\textbf{Classification problem.} For the presentation of the three required
Neural Network architecture, we set the constraint to present only the Neural
Networks in a classification setting rather than for a regression problem. \\

\textbf{Data set.} First of all, we focus on training our model on a dataset
containing English spoken numbers. After having trained the model successfully
on this dataset, we train it on the smaller Luxembourgish dataset and analyse
its prediction accuracy. Since we aren't able to collect as much voice
recordings as the English data set, we should not expect high accuracy.\\

\textbf{Framework implementation.} We do not implement the Neural Networks
architecture since existing deep learning libraries such as Keras are already
matured. Thereby, we focus on explaining how the APIs work and how to use them
in our model.\\
