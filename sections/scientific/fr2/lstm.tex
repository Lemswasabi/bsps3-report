\subsubsection{Long short-term memory}~\\


An LSTM unit is composed of a memory cell, an input gate, an output gate and a
forget gate. The cell stores information over a long period and the three gates
control the flow of information through the cell. RNNs using LSTM units deal
with the vanishing gradient problem because these units allow gradients to flow
unchanged.\cite{doi:10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735}\\

The standard formulation of a single LSTM cell can be given by the following
equations:

\begin{align}
  f_t &= \sigma(W_f h_{t-1}+V_f x_t+b_f)\\
  i_t &= \sigma(W_i h_{t-1}+V_i x_t+b_i)\\
  C_t^{'} &= \tanh(W_C h_{t-1}+V_C x_t+b_C)\\
  C_t &= f_t C_{t-1}+i_t C_t^{'}\\
  o_t &= \sigma(W_o h_{t-1}+V_o x_t+b_o)\\
  h_t &= o_t \tanh(C_t)
\end{align}

where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, $\tanh$ is the hyperbolic tangent
function, $f,i,C^{'},C,o$ are the forget gate, input gate, new memory cell
content, and memory cell content, output gate respectively. See representation
of an LSTM cell in Figure~\ref{memorycell}.
