\subsection{Requirements}
% Describe here all the properties that characterize the deliverables you
% produced. It should describe, for each main deliverable, what are the expected
% functional and non functional properties of the deliverables, who are the actors
% exploiting the deliverables. It is expected that you have at least one
% scientific deliverable (e.g. ``Scientific presentation of the Python programming
% language'', ``State of the art on quality models for human computer
% interaction'', \ldots.) and one technical deliverable (e.g. ``BSProSoft - A
% python/django web-site for IT job offers retrieval and analysis'', \ldots). \\

\begin{itemize} 
  \item \textbf{FR01} Present the feature extraction with MFCCs. \\
  \item \textbf{FR02} Investigate the notions of deep learning and Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANNs).\\
    This should give an introduction to the domain of deep learning. It presents
    an overview of four different ANNs architectures, each of them covered by a
    brief introduction and theoretical
    aspect.\\
  \item \textbf{NFR01} Performance evaluation and comparison.\\ 
    During this section, we present and discuss the results obtained using four
    Neural Network architectures.
\end{itemize}
