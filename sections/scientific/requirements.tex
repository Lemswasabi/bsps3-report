\subsection{Requirements}
% Describe here all the properties that characterize the deliverables you
% produced. It should describe, for each main deliverable, what are the expected
% functional and non functional properties of the deliverables, who are the actors
% exploiting the deliverables. It is expected that you have at least one
% scientific deliverable (e.g. ``Scientific presentation of the Python programming
% language'', ``State of the art on quality models for human computer
% interaction'', \ldots.) and one technical deliverable (e.g. ``BSProSoft - A
% python/django web-site for IT job offers retrieval and analysis'', \ldots). \\

\begin{itemize} 
  \item \textbf{FR01} Present the feature extraction with MFCC \\
  \item \textbf{FR02} Present the notions of deep learning and Artificial Neural
    Networks (ANNs)\\
    This should present an introduction to the domain of deep learning. It
    presents an overview of 3 different ANNs architectures. Every Neural Network
    presentation will cover a small introduction and theoretical aspect.\\

  \item \textbf{NFR01} Performance evaluation and comparison\\ 
    During this section, we compare and analyse the performance obtained from
    the three Neural Networks architecture.
