\subsection{Requirements ($\pm$ 15\% of section's words)}
% Describe here all the properties that characterize the deliverables you
% produced. It should describe, for each main deliverable, what are the expected
% functional and non functional properties of the deliverables, who are the actors
% exploiting the deliverables. It is expected that you have at least one
% scientific deliverable (e.g. ``Scientific presentation of the Python programming
% language'', ``State of the art on quality models for human computer
% interaction'', \ldots.) and one technical deliverable (e.g. ``BSProSoft - A
% python/django web-site for IT job offers retrieval and analysis'', \ldots). \\

\textcolor{gray}{Functional Requirement (FR) and Non-Functional Requirement
  (NFR)} 
\begin{itemize} 
  \item \textbf{FR01} Present the notions of deep learning and Neural Networks\\
    This should present an introduction to the domain of deep learning. It
    presents an overview of 3 different Neural Network architectures.  Every
    Neural Network presentation will be divided into a small introduction and
    theoretical aspect.\\
  \item \textbf{FR02} Present the feature extraction with MFCC \\
  \item \textbf{NFR01} Accuracy comparison\\
    During this section, we compare and analyse the accuracies obtained from the
    three Neural Networks architecture.
\end{itemize}
