\section{Conclusion}
% In this BSP we presented three different ML algorithms and their applicational
% use. We outperformed the baseline \cite{NaMaMi19} with our framework.
% Throughout this project, I learnt a lot about machine learning and software
% development with Python. Studying machine learning gives me a good background
% in data preprocessing and model training. This will benefit me for my next BSP
% which will be based on deep learning with the application on speech recognition.
