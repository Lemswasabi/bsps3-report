\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, end-to-end isolated word recognition using deep neural networks
was treated. Four different ANN models were investigated. The results showed,
that gated RNNs outperform basic feedforward and recurrent neural networks.
These RNNs were applied to our collected Luxembourgish dataset and yielded very
good results. The background, which includes knowledge in programming and
machine learning, acquired prior this BSP gave me the ability to grasp easily the
notions of deep learning. This project will give me enough background to
continue on my next BSP which deals with attention-based models for speech
recognition.
