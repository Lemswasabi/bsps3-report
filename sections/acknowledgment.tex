I would like to thank my tutor Vladimir Despotovic for his constructive feedback
and mentorship. His introduction and explanation of neural networks were
outstanding. Additionally, I thank him for supervising my paper. I would
recommend fellow BiCS Students interested in this field to work with Vladimir
Despotovic.
