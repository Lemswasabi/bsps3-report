\subsubsection{FR02: Luxembourgish dataset collection}\label{datasetlux}~\\

To collect the Luxembourgish dataset, the \textit{Teachable
Machine}\cite{teachablemachine} was used. It contains a recorder to create a
dataset consisting of audio files. The recording of the audio files can be set
to $1s$. However, the recorder saves the files in the \textit{.webm} file type.
Therefore, the audio files have to be converted to \textit{.wav} files before
the features can be extracted. The following bash script using the
\textit{ffmpeg} command converts the audio files in a file directory to the
desired file format:

\lstset{
  language = Bash,

  columns  = fullflexible,
  keepspaces,
}
