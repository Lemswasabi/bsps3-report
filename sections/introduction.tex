\section{Introduction}

This paper presents the Bachelor Semester Project (BSP) made by Le Minh Nguyen
together with Vladimir Despotovic as his motivated tutor. The project is divided
into two periods. In the first period, we implement our classification model to
recognize spoken words. The first period contains the following concepts:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Data preprocessing.
\item Training set and testing set.
\item Deep Neural Networks architecture: Deep Feedforward Neural Networks and
  Recurrent Neural Networks, which are presented in the popular Deep Learning
  textbook~\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.
\end{itemize}

In the second period, we explain the deep Neural Networks architecture and compare their
accuracies obtained during our classification experiment.\\
