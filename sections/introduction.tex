\section{Introduction}

This paper presents the Bachelor Semester Project (BSP) made by Le Minh Nguyen
together with Vladimir Despotovic as his motivated tutor. The project is divided
into two parts. The first part implements the end-to-end speech word recognition
model using the following concepts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Data collection and preprocessing.
\item Deep Neural Networks architecture: Deep Feedforward Neural Networks and
  Recurrent Neural Networks, which are presented in the popular Deep Learning
  textbook~\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.
\end{itemize}

In the second part, we explain the deep Neural Networks architecture and compare their
performance obtained during our classification experiment.\\
